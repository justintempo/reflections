What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It's the first step in setting up a repository for your directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a middle ground between the working directory and the repository. It's like purgatory for new commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Not sure with this one. I guess making you add one file at a time forces you to think about real changes?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you've got a big experimental change that you want to try, or you've got several different versions of the same project that you want to develop in parallel.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help you understand where and how you branched off.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It combines all of the changes from the two versions automatically.
