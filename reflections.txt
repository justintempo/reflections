How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It identified what had changed from the last version, which worked, to the new one, which didn't.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would allow you to see its changes over time and assess what kinds of things needed to be change.d

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

So that you don't have to think about which files to save.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows you a list of the changes made to the file. Git diff will find those changes in the code and show you a comparison of the old and new.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It's easy to go back to when it wasn't broken, so you're less afraid to experiment.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it for version control on all of my projects.
